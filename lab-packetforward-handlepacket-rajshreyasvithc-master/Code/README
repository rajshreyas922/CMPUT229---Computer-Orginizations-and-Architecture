Lab_PacketForward-HandlePacket

Code
    > handlePacket.s : write your solution to the lab in this file
    > common.s : code that loads an IP packet into memory, calls your handlePacket 
        function
    > checksum.s: paste your code from the the previous lab into this file excluding the 
        line '.include "common.s". Use the checksum function in your solution. This file
        will be not be used in grading, it will be replaced with a checksum.s file with a 
        correct implementation of checksum.s
