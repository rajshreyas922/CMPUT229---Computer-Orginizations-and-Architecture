Lab_SIRD-Model

Code:
    > sird.s - write your sird function and your interrupt handler in this file
    > common.s - RISC-V code that initializes four global variables to use in your LCG
        implementation, allocates space for the interrupt trap data, stores the 
        address of the allocated memory into the uscratch control status register, 
        calls the student's sird function then finally exits.
    > Demo - contains a sample program displayDemo.s that prints a string onto 
        the Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator
